	The North Eastern states of India are linked to the seventh largest landmass by a tiny strip of land. When the country was made theirs, they were promised. But today, more mentally than geographically, we have made them foreign, seperate and unworthy of opportunity.
	Perhaps AAHVAAN doesn't want to bring about a revolution. Perhaps we just want you to pause. And notice the silence in the North East.

	<p>
 <h1>Rules:</h1>
        
    
 <li>   All FIDE Rules apply as on 1st Jan 2017 unless otherwise mentioned. </li>
 <li>   The basic pairing system shall be Controlled Swiss System Pairings using Match Points for
both Pairing and Scoring. </li>

    <li>   Time control: 25 minutes plus an additional 10 second increment per move.</li>
 <li>Number of rounds will be decided depending on the number of participating teams. </li>
 <li>Chess clocks shall be provided to top boards in cases on shortage of clocks. Participants can use their own chess clocks for the matches. </li>
 <li>  A team must consist of a maximum of 5 players, with 4 players playing in the
tournament and one player playing as a substitute. </li>
 <li> There shall be no restriction to including women players in the Chess Team. <li>
 <li> Each team must clearly state the playing order of its team while sending the entry. If
the team wishes to play their substitute in a particular round, the Team Captain should
intimate this to the Chief Arbiter before the round begins. Rules for substitution have
been explained below in detail. </li>
<li> Each team is required to play through the entire tournament. Teams which do not play
two rounds in succession shall be automatically disqualified and their name shall be
struck off from the pairing list. </li>
<li>Each team shall be awarded 1 point for a win, 0.5 points for a 2-2 draw and 0 points in
case of a loss. In case of the same number of points of two winning teams, the winner
shall be adjudged according to FIDE guidelines.</li>
<li>The final positions of the teams shall be established by the number of game points
scored by each team.</li>
<li>Only one participating team is permitted from a single college. The host college shall
have 2 participating teams in the tournament.</li>
    <li>In case of any dispute, the decision of the Chief Arbiter shall be considered final and
binding.</li>
<h2>Rules for substitution:</h2>
 <li> "Roll over substitution" </li>
 <li>The boards lower to the board on which substitution is made will slide up one board till
the board of substitution.
Example 1: Assume the following board order- A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4. Substitute player E. In
case, the player A (on board 1) is to be substituted, the new board order should be B-1,
C-2, D-3, E-4 (Non- playing A).
