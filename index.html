Life's such a messy run of deadlines, smoke, anger, grades, sadness and mundane schedules. 
The run is inevitable; without it, we would not survive.
So why not make the run itself fun? 
AAHVAAN brings to you the Color Run!

Filled with music and rhythm, dance, drama and friends on all bends; the beautiful hues of your life in a campus that will become yours.

The AAHVAAN Color Run will also represent the nation we are: vast, diverse and colorful, as it brings to the fore the North East, running its multifold colors through your veins.
<b>
So join us for a beautiful, madcap, unifying adventure at 9 a.m. on 26th March 2017 at D.T.U.</b>
